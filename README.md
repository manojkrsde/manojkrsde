## 💡 About Me

I'm a backend developer and fullstack trainer with a love for writing clean, scalable code and simplifying complex tech for learners and teams. Currently, I train students on fullstack development and cloud technologies at an IBM partner organization.

I bring hands-on experience building real-world systems—from airline booking platforms to full-featured e-commerce apps. Whether it’s working with databases or deploying to the cloud, I enjoy building things that solve real problems.
